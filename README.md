# Linear Feedback Shift Register

## Overview

An LFSR consists of clocked storage elements (flip-flops) and a feedback path. The number of storage elements gives us the degree of the LFSR. In other words, an LFSR with m flip-flops is said to be of degree m. The feedback network computes the input for the last flip-flop as XOR-sum of certain flip-flops in the shift register. Whether a feedback path is active or not, is defined by the feedback coefficient p. The rightmost column is the output of the LFSR.
